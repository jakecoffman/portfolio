            <p>After reading about standing desks and getting back pain from the cheap chairs at work, I decided to
                    ditch sitting
                    and embrace vertical computing at home. Being a hacker/maker I decided to build one myself, with
                    much assistance
                    from my brother who graciously supplied the workspace and the wood.

                <p>Now that I have been using a standing desk for a few years, I've noticed a few things. First,
                    whenever I feel like I want to get a drink or go check out something in the other room,
                    I just go. Before I felt like I would wait for a good opportunity to walk around, but since I'm
                    standing already I
                    just go for it. Next, I move very often while standing. I sway back and forth, kick back a leg now
                    and then, and
                    lean back. It's very natural and I do it without thinking. My final observation is it makes me feel
                    lazy to watch TV
                    while sitting. My PC is now healthier for me to use than the TV!
